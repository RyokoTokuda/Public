#sim_spinering
 
"sim_spinering" is a simulations with Python.
I reproduced the dynamics of actin rings located on dendritic spines.
 
# Features 
In this simulation, the ring consists with several linear fragments representing actin filaments.
They are bundled with myosins and slide bidirectionally with each other.
After that event, the ring diameter as whole will change (increase/decrease).
 
# Usage
Run "0608_main.py".
At the end of the running, the results which show the rings with the dots as myosins appear.
